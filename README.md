# chia-plotter (pipelined multi-threaded)

This is a new implementation of a chia plotter which is designed as a processing pipeline,
similar to how GPUs work, only the "cores" are normal software CPU threads.

As a result this plotter is able to fully max out any storage device's bandwidth,
simply by increasing the number of "cores", ie. threads.

## Usage

Check discord for support: https://discord.gg/YJ4GSMMY

```
For <poolkey> and <farmerkey> see output of `chia keys show`.
<tmpdir> needs about 220 GiB space, it will handle about 25% of all writes. (Examples: './', '/mnt/tmp/')
<tmpdir2> needs about 110 GiB space and ideally is a RAM drive, it will handle about 75% of all writes.
Combined (tmpdir + tmpdir2) peak disk usage is less than 256 GiB.
In case of <count> != 1, you may press Ctrl-C for graceful termination after current plot is finished or double Ctrl-c to terminate immediatelly\

Usage:
  chia_plot [OPTION...]

  -n, --count arg      Number of plots to create (default = 1, -1 = infinite)
  -r, --threads arg    Number of threads (default = 4)
  -u, --buckets arg    Number of buckets (default = 256)
  -v, --buckets3 arg   Number of buckets for phase 3+4 (default = buckets)
  -t, --tmpdir arg     Temporary directory, needs ~220 GiB (default = $PWD)
  -2, --tmpdir2 arg    Temporary directory 2, needs ~110 GiB [RAM] (default = <tmpdir>)
  -d, --finaldir arg   Final directory (default = <tmpdir>)
  -p, --poolkey arg    Pool Public Key (48 bytes)
  -f, --farmerkey arg  Farmer Public Key (48 bytes)
  -G, --tmptoggle      Alternate tmpdir/tmpdir2 (default = false)
  -l, --logdir         Directory to hold the log files
      --help           Print help
```

Make sure to crank up `<threads>` if you have plenty of cores, the default is 4.
Depending on the phase more threads will be launched, the setting is just a multiplier.

RAM usage depends on `<threads>` and `<buckets>`.
With the new default of 256 buckets it's about 0.5 GB per thread at most.

`-G` option will alternate the temp dirs used while plotting to give each one, tmpdir and tmpdir2, equal usage. The first plot creation will use tmpdir and tmpdir2 as expected. The next run, if -n equals 2 or more, will swap the order to tmpdir2 and tmpdir. The next run swaps again to tmpdir and tmpdir2. This will occur until the number of plots created is reached or until stopped.

### RAM disk setup on Linux
`sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=110G tmpfs /mnt/ram/`

Note: 128 GiB System RAM minimum required for RAM disk.

## How to Verify

To make sure the plots are valid you can use the `ProofOfSpace` tool from [chiapos](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos.git
cd chiapos && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8
./ProofOfSpace check -f plot-k32-???.plot [num_iterations]
```

## Future Plans

I do have some history with GPU mining, back in 2014 I was the first to open source a XPM GPU miner,
which was about 40x more efficient than the CPU miner. See my other repos.

As such, it's only a matter of time until I'll add OpenCL support to speed up the plotter even more,
keeping most of the load off the CPUs.

cd chia-plotter

git submodule update --init
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install cmake3 libsodium libsodium-static -y
ln /usr/bin/cmake3 /usr/bin/cmake
# Install a package with repository for your system:
# On CentOS, install package centos-release-scl available in CentOS repository:
sudo yum install centos-release-scl -y
# Install the collection:
sudo yum install devtoolset-7 -y
# Start using software collections:
scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
./make_devel.sh
./build/chia_plot --help
```
---
### Clear Linux
```bash
sudo swupd update
sudo swupd bundle-add c-basic devpkg-libsodium git wget

echo PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/ # for statically compiled cmake if not already in your PATH

# Install libsodium
cd /tmp
wget https://download.libsodium.org/libsodium/releases/LATEST.tar.gz
tar -xvf LATEST.tar.gz
cd libsodium-stable
./configure
make && make check
sudo make install
# Checkout the source and install
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter.git 
cd ~/chia-plotter
git submodule update --init
./make_devel.sh
./build/chia_plot --help
```

---
### Ubuntu 20.04
```bash
sudo apt install -y libsodium-dev cmake g++ git
# Checkout the source and install
git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter.git 
cd chia-plotter

git submodule update --init
./make_devel.sh
./build/chia_plot --help
```

The binaries will end up in `build/`, you can copy them elsewhere freely (on the same machine, or similar OS).

---
### Debian 10 ("buster")

Make sure to add buster-backports to your sources.list otherwise the installation will fail because an older cmake version. See the [debian backport documentation](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions/) for reference.

```bash
# Install cmake 3.16 from buster-backports
sudo apt install -t buster-backports cmake
sudo apt install -y libsodium-dev g++ git
# Checkout the source and install
git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter.git 
cd chia-plotter

git submodule update --init
./make_devel.sh
./build/chia_plot --help
```
The binaries will end up in `build/`, you can copy them elsewhere freely (on the same machine, or similar OS).

---
### macOS
First you need to install a package manager called [Brew](https://brew.sh/) and [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) OR [CommandLineTools](https://developer.apple.com/download/).
```bash
# Alternative way to download CommandLineTools on Terminal:
xcode-select --install

brew install libsodium cmake git autoconf automake libtool wget

# If you downloaded Xcode run these:
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/sodium.h /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/sodium /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include/

# If you downloaded CommandLineTools run these:
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/sodium.h /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/sodium /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include

brew link cmake
```

Confirm which directory you have on YOUR Mac before applying following commands
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookincubator/fizz/master/build/fbcode_builder/CMake/FindSodium.cmake -O /usr/local/opt/cmake/share/cmake/Modules/FindSodium.cmake
```
 or
``` 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebookincubator/fizz/master/build/fbcode_builder/CMake/FindSodium.cmake -O /opt/homebrew/Cellar/cmake/3.20.3/share/cmake/Modules/FindSodium.cmake
```

```
git clone https://github.com/madMAx43v3r/chia-plotter.git 
cd chia-plotter
git submodule update --init
./make_devel.sh
./build/chia_plot --help
```
If a maximum open file limit error occurs (as default OS setting is 256, which is too low for default bucket size of `256`), run this before starting the plotter
```
ulimit -n 3000
```
This file limit change will only affect the current session.

## Running in a Docker container

In some setups and scenarios, it could be useful to run your plotter inside a Docker container. This could be potentially useful while running `chia-plotter` in Windows.

To do so, install Docker in your computer and them run the following command:

```sh
docker run \
  -v <path-to-your-tmp-dir>:/mnt/harvester \
  -v <path-to-your-final-dir>:/mnt/farm \
  odelucca/chia-plotter \
    -t /mnt/harvester/ \
    -d /mnt/farm/ \
    -p <pool-key> \
    -f <farm-key> \
    -r <number-of-CPU-cores>
```
> 💡 You can provide any of the plotter arguments after the image name (`odelucca/chia-plotter`)

In a Linux benchmark, we were able to find that running in Docker has only 5% performance impact than running in native OS.

For Windows users, you should check if your Docker configuration has any RAM or CPU limits. Since Docker runs inside HyperV, that could potentially constrain your hardware usage. In any case, you can set the RAM limits with the `-m` flag (after the `docker run` command).

### Regarding multithread in Docker

While running in Windows, you may need to proper configure your Docker to allow multi CPUs. You can do so by following [this article](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/docker-container-cpu-limits-explained/)

In a nutshell, you could also pass the `--cpus` flag to your `docker run` command in order to achieve the same result.

So, for example, the following command:
```sh
docker run \
  -v <path-to-your-tmp-dir>:/mnt/harvester \
  -v <path-to-your-final-dir>:/mnt/farm \
  -m 8G \
  --cpus 8 \
  odelucca/chia-plotter \
    -t /mnt/harvester/ \
    -d /mnt/farm/ \
    -p <pool-key> \
    -f <farm-key> \
    -r 8
```

Would run your plotter with 8 CPUs and 8GB of RAM.
