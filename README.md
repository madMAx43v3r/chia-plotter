# chia-plotter (pipelined multi-threaded)

This is a new implementation of a chia plotter which is designed as a processing pipeline,
similar to how GPUs work, only the "cores" are normal software CPU threads.

As a result this plotter is able to fully max out any storage device's bandwidth,
simply by increasing the number of "cores", ie. threads.

## Usage

```
For <poolkey> and <farmerkey> see output of `chia keys show`.
<tmpdir> needs about 220 GiB space, it will handle about 25% of all writes. (Examples: './', '/mnt/tmp/')
<tmpdir2> needs about 110 GiB space and ideally is a RAM drive, it will handle about 75% of all writes.
Combined (tmpdir + tmpdir2) peak disk usage is less than 256 GiB.

Usage:
  chia_plot [OPTION...]

  -n, --count arg      Number of plots to create (default = 1, -1 = infinite)
  -r, --threads arg    Number of threads (default = 4)
  -u, --buckets arg    Number of buckets (default = 128)
  -t, --tmpdir arg     Temporary directory, needs ~220 GiB (default = $PWD)
  -2, --tmpdir2 arg    Temporary directory 2, needs ~110 GiB [RAM] (default = <tmpdir>)
  -d, --finaldir arg   Final directory (default = <tmpdir>)
  -p, --poolkey arg    Pool Public Key (48 bytes)
  -f, --farmerkey arg  Farmer Public Key (48 bytes)
      --help           Print help
```

Make sure to crank up `<threads>` if you have plenty of cores, the default is 4.
Depending on the phase more threads will be launched, the setting is just a multiplier.

RAM usage depends on `<threads>` and `<buckets>`. With default `<buckets>` it's about 1 GB per thread at most.

## How to Support

I developed this on my own time, even though I already filled all my HDDs (~50 TiB) with the official (slow) plotter.

## How to Verify

To make sure the plots are valid you can use the `ProofOfSpace` tool from [chiapos](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chia-Network/chiapos.git
cd chiapos && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make -j8
./ProofOfSpace check -f plot-k32-???.plot [num_iterations]
```

## Future Plans

I do have some history with GPU mining, back in 2014 I was the first to open source a XPM GPU miner,
which was about 40x more efficient than the CPU miner. See my other repos.

As such, it's only a matter of time until I'll add OpenCL support to speed up the plotter even more,
keeping most of the load off the CPUs.

## Running in a Docker container

In some setups and scenarios, it could be useful to run your plotter inside a Docker container. This could be potentially useful while running `chia-plotter` in Windows.

To do so, install Docker in your computer and them run the following command:

```sh
docker run \
  -v <path-to-your-tmp-dir>:/mnt/harvester \
  -v <path-to-your-final-dir>:/mnt/farm \
  odelucca/chia-plotter \
    -t /mnt/harvester/ \
    -d /mnt/farm/ \
    -p <pool-key> \
    -f <farm-key> \
    -r <number-of-CPU-cores>
```
> ðŸ’¡ You can provide any of the plotter arguments after the image name (`odelucca/chia-plotter`)

In a Linux benchmark, we were able to find that running in Docker has only 5% performance impact than running in native OS.

For Windows users, you should check if your Docker configuration has any RAM or CPU limits. Since Docke runs inside HyperV, that could potentially constrain your hardware usage. In any case, you can set the RAM limits with the `-m` flag (after the `docker run` command).

### Regarding multithread in Docker

While running in Windows, you may need to proper configure your Docker to allow multi CPUs. You can do so by following [this article](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/docker-container-cpu-limits-explained/)

In a nutshell, you could also pass the `--cpus` flag to your `docker run` command in order to achieve the same result.

So, for example, the following command:
```sh
docker run \
  -v <path-to-your-tmp-dir>:/mnt/harvester \
  -v <path-to-your-final-dir>:/mnt/farm \
  -m 8000 \
  --cpus 8 \
  odelucca/chia-plotter \
    -t /mnt/harvester/ \
    -d /mnt/farm/ \
    -p <pool-key> \
    -f <farm-key> \
    -r 8
```

Would run your plotter with 8 CPUs and 8GB of RAM.

## Known Issues

- Doesn't compile with gcc-11, use a lower version.
- Needs at least cmake 3.14 (because of bls-signatures)
